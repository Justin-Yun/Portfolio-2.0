I created load-injection simulators for the Performance Tools Team using Visual C++ and MFC. I developed applications using Java, Spring Boot, and GraphQL, with a focus on leveraging GraphQL over Spring Boot's built-in functions. I successfully reduced technical debt by 78% through focused efforts. I coordinated and executed the migration of projects from TFS to GitHub and implemented a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. I established an automated workflow for building and deploying internal tools. I am skilled in working with agile teams and certified in SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)."
